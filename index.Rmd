`movsr` is research software designed to scape and reformat the [Missouri Attorney General's Office](https://ago.mo.gov/) [annual vehicle stop reports](https://ago.mo.gov/home/vehicle-stops-report/). 

## For Researchers
This site offers a walk through in the [Get started article](articles/movsr.html) for using `movsr` for scraping and formating vehicle stop data as well as [documentation](reference/index.html) for project specific functions.

The `movsr` software can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/movsr")
```

Additional details, including some tips for installing and using Docker, can be found in the [Get started article](articles/movsr.html#getting-started) as well.
